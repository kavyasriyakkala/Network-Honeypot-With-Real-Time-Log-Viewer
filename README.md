Honeypot Project is a simple network security tool that captures and analyzes suspicious traffic. This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a honeypotâ€”a security mechanism used to attract, detect, and investigate unauthorized access attempts or malicious activity.

Key Features:

1) Honeypot Server: Utilizes Python's socket library to create a TCP server that listens on port 8080. It captures incoming connections, logs the data, and provides valuable insights into network attacks.
  
2) Log Viewer: A Flask-powered web application that displays captured log entries in a user-friendly table format. The interface allows easy examination of attack data and network activity.

3) Summary Page: An interactive summary page aggregates key statistics from the log data, such as the total number of attacks and unique IP addresses, providing a high-level view of the network's threat landscape.

4) Responsive Design: Features a modern and aesthetic UI using Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. Includes a clean start page with a central button for navigation, a well-organized log table, and a summary page with dynamic data display.
